OpenBot Validation & Semantic Retrieval System

OpenBot is a FastAPI + Qdrant based intelligent query understanding and validation system.
It uses SentenceTransformer (intfloat/e5-base-v2) as its local embedding model ‚Äî (qwen2.5:7b)LLMs for validation.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Overview
Component	Purpose	Notes
FastAPI	REST API layer for validation and reasoning	Async-capable
SentenceTransformer (E5-Base-V2)	Local text embedding model	Used for both query understanding and matching
Qdrant	Vector DB for fast semantic retrieval	Runs in Docker
Torch + NumPy	Vector math and device acceleration	Uses GPU if available

üßæ Example Query Flow
Input
{
  "query": "List all Fintech companies in the UK"
}

Processing Steps

The query is embedded using E5-Base-V2

Qdrant returns the top-matching filters

The server builds a semantic response + suggestions
